        <p>I grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It's known as the city of bridges. This
            is because Pittsburgh is located at the confluence of three different rivers.
            To travel into Pittsburgh, you must cross over one of these rivers that surrounds
            Pittsburgh from almost every side.
