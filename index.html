                <p> Hello, my name is Boyd Stinnett and I am from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I am currently thirty years old
                    and pursuing my second bachelor's degree in software development. My first bachelor's degree was in
                    biochemistry
                    from Utah State University. I worked at a pharmaceutical company in a laboratory for a few years but really
                    did not
                    enjoy my job. It was only when a friend showed me the basics of programming in Python that I became
                    extremely interested
                    in pursuing a career in software development. I'm prety early on in my software development education but I
                    have really
                    enjoyed every class.
                    to school and taking on more debt but BYU Pathway has allowed it to be affordable for me.

                <p>I grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It's known as the city of bridges. This
                    is because Pittsburgh is located at the confluence of three different rivers.
                    To travel into Pittsburgh, you must cross over one of these rivers that surrounds
                    Pittsburgh from almost every side.
